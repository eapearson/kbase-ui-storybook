# KBase UI Storybook

This is a (storybook)[https://storybook.js.org] implementation for KBase UI and friends.

At present it covers just part of Ant Design. We are fleshing this out. It is not yet usable.

That said, here is how to use it

-   ensure you have node and npm installed
-   clone this repo
-   enter the repo directory
-   install dependencies
    -   `npm install`
-   run the storybook dev server:
    -   `npm run storybook`
-   to update the storybook, just edit the files within src/stories
-   to build and deploy
    -   TO BE DONE
