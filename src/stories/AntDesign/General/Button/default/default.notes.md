The _default button_ is subdued in order to not draw too much attention from more important components. The meaning of the button should be evident from the label and/or icon, in contrast to <a>danger</a> or <a>primary</a> buttons which have some semantic meaning.

```jsx
<Button>Default Button</Button>
```

or

```jsx
<Button type="default">Default Button</Button>
```
